# Apache - PHP configuration

[Pretty cool article](https://medium.com/@JohnFoderaro/how-to-set-up-apache-in-macos-sierra-10-12-bca5a5dfffba) on how to configure on MacOS Sierra Apache and PHP. Detail compiled details I needed without the explanation plus omitted some steps I didn't needed.

## Create a folder where you'll be hosting your projects

In this case I'll use `Sites` folder which is the default one on Mac. You can create one elsewhere and it would be the same.

`$ mkdir ~/Sites`

## Create a project folder

This will be a subdirectory where you'll be creating all the rest of the project you can work on.

`$ mkdir ~/Sites/ifrantar`
