# Useful commands and customizations

The purpose of this repo is to collect resources I search for to tweak my system whether that is my Mac, my Git repos or anything that I want to keep useful notes off.

So far I have:

- [Mac Commands](mac-commands.md)
- [Git Commands](git-commands.md)
- [Bash Profile](bash-profile.bash)

This file—and other files in the directory—will keep growing as I find and optimize my workflow and environments.
